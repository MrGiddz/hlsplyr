00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.340
Hello, welcome to exampaddy's biology class.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:25.280
Our topic today is homeostasis part 1 and we will be learning about homeostasis and

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.260
osmoregulation.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.700
At the end of this lesson, you should be able to 1.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.340
Explain homeostasis and osmoregulation 2.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.040
Describe the functions of the kidneys and how they carry out homeostasis.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.520
Homeostasis is the state of steady internal, physical and chemical conditions maintained

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.880
by living systems.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:01:00.940
It is a self-regulating process by which biological systems tend to maintain stability while adjusting

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.700
to optimal conditions.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.060
Homeostasis is quite crucial to the survival of organisms.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.800
If homeostasis is successful, life continues.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.640
If unsuccessful, disaster or death ensues.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.420
What's the temperature in your room right now?

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.720
I guess it's not exactly 37 degrees Celsius.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.940
Yes, your body temperature is usually very close to this value.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:39.780
The control of body temperature in humans is a good example of homeostasis in biological

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.540
systems.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.420
In humans, normal body temperature fluctuates around the value of 37 degrees Celsius, but

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:57.960
various factors can affect this value, including exposure, hormones, metabolic rates and diseases,

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.240
leading to excessively high or low temperatures.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.120
The body's temperature regulation is controlled by a region in the brain called the hypothalamus.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:19.520
A homeostatic process that controls the amount of water in body fluids is known as osmoregulation.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.580
Osmoregulation is a process that regulates the osmotic pressure of fluids and electrolytic

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.240
balance in organisms.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.900
In animals, this process is brought about by osmoreceptors, which can detect change in

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.120
osmotic pressures.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.700
Humans and most other warm-blooded organisms have osmoreceptors in their hypothalamus.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.660
Besides the brain, osmoregulation is also found in the kidneys.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.380
Osmoregulation is essential to all organisms as it maintains the organism's water content.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.300
There are two major kinds of osmoregulation.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.460
The first one is called osmoconformers.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.600
These are organisms that try to match the osmolarity of their body with their surroundings.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:25.480
In other words, these organisms maintain the same osmotic pressure inside the body as outside

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.940
water.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.720
They conform either through active or passive means.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:39.160
Most marine invertebrates such as starfish, jellyfish, and lobsters are osmoconformers.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.380
The second one is osmoregulators.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.860
Osmoregulators are organisms that actively regulate their osmotic pressure independent

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.080
of the surrounding environment.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.480
Many vertebrates, including humans, are osmoregulatory.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.880
Most freshwater fish are considered to be osmoregulatory too.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.700
Different organisms exhibit different types of osmoregulation.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.220
Freshwater fish and marine water fish osmoregulate in different ways because their environments

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.460
have varying levels of salinity.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.480
Let's talk about osmoregulation in freshwater fish.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:34.260
Freshwater fishes are hypotonic to their surrounding environment, which means that the concentration

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.720
of salt is higher in their blood than in their surrounding water.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.460
They absorb a controlled amount of water through the mouth and gill membranes.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.880
Due to this intake of water, they produce large quantities of urine through which a

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.340
lot of salt is lost.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.940
The salt is replaced with the help of mitochondrial-rich cells in the gills.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.640
These cells absorb salt into the blood from the surrounding water.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.380
Osmoregulation in marine fish.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:18.000
Compared to freshwater fish, marine fish face the opposite problem.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.160
They have a higher concentration of water in their body than in their surrounding environment.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.420
Consequently, it results in the tendency to lose water and absorb the salt.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:39.280
To get around this problem, marine fish drink large quantities of water and restrict urination.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.820
Osmoregulation in plants.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.920
Plants use stomata on the lower side of their leaves to regulate water loss.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:57.100
Plants growing in hydrated soil compensate for water loss through transpiration by absorbing

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.940
more water from the soil.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:07.200
The plants that grow in semi-arid areas store water in the vacuoles and have thick and fleshy

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.960
corticals to prevent water loss.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.700
Osmoregulation in unicellular organisms, such as Paramecium.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:24.180
Osmoregulation is done by organelles called contractile vacuoles.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:33.220
These contractile vacuoles are spherical-shaped structures surrounded by a series of radiating

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.920
ducts.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:42.900
These ducts collect water and pump it into the central area by means of contractile fibers

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.160
that contract and force the water into the center.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:55.420
When the vacuoles are full, the unicellular organism contracts, forcing the water outside

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.120
the cell.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:05.700
Here is a diagram showing the process of osmoregulation in unicellular organisms, focusing on Amoeba

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.000
and Paramecium as a case study.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.120
Osmoregulation in humans.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.980
The kidney is the main organ responsible for osmoregulation in humans.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.980
Water, amino acids, and glucose are reabsorbed by the kidneys.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:31.800
When the water level in the body is high, it releases a large amount of hypotonic urine.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:40.020
When the water is low, it retains water and produces a low amount of hypotonic urine.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:46.040
Thus, the kidney maintains the electrolytic balance of the body.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:53.420
The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:59.400
They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of your spine.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:07.680
However, the kidney filters about a half cup of blood every minute, removing waste and

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.280
extra water to make urine.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.680
Here's a diagram of the kidney.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.140
Why are the kidneys so important?

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:25.240
1. The major function of the kidney is to remove waste products and excess fluid as

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.320
urine from the body.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:33.020
2. The kidney regulates the body's salts, potassium, and acid.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:39.480
3. They produce hormones that affect the functions of other organs.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:46.180
For example, a hormone produced by the kidneys stimulates rare blood cell production.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:54.420
4. The kidney also produces an active form of vitamin D that promotes strong healthy

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:59.300
bones and also controls production of red blood cells.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.380
An easy way to memorize the seven different roles that the kidneys play in human health

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:12.820
is using a simple and funny pneumatic formula called a wet bed.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:18.580
A means controlling acid-base balance.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.760
W, controlling water balance.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.300
E, maintaining electrolyte balance.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.940
C, removing toxins and waste products from the body.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.600
B, controlling blood pressure.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.560
E, producing the hormone erythropoietin.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.600
D, activating vitamin D.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.640
We've come to the end of today's lesson.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:54.560
Answer the following questions to test your knowledge of the topic.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.720
1. Explain homeostasis and osmoregulation.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:06.440
2. Describe the functions of the kidney and how they carry out homeostasis.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.680
Thank you for learning about homeostasis and osmoregulation with me.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.060
I'll see you in our next video.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:14.860
Bye!

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.860
